# SQL Projects Repository

Welcome to my SQL projects repository! In this repository, you will find two small projects developed with Oracle SQL. Below, I will provide a brief description of each project.

## Description

### Project001 (Oracle)

This SQL script creates and modifies multiple tables related to a pharmacy database, including tables for discounts, supervisors, accounts, medications, coffee machines, pharmaceuticals, and laboratories. Each table has its own set of constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique values, and non-null values.

### Project002 (Oracle)

Project002 builds upon Project001 script. The given code contains various SQL queries with different functionalities such as subqueries, joins, group functions, and conditions. These queries retrieve information from multiple tables and perform calculations and filtering based on specific conditions.

### Project003 (PostgreSQL)

The project involves the installation and configuration of PostgreSQL.

### Project004 (PostgreSQL)

This project creates users and roles with specific privileges in a database. It also creates two views: order_summary to summarize order details, and user_purchases to display user purchase information.

### Project005 (PostgreSQL)

This project establishes a database schema with three tables and populates them with sample data. Additionally, it encompasses exercises that utilize stored procedures, functions, and views to manipulate and retrieve data for various users within the database.
